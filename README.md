# 🧊 IceStack

**IceStack** is a strategic web-based block puzzle game built using **React + TypeScript + HTML5 Canvas**.
Inspired by modern block placement games, IceStack introduces a unique **Freeze / Unfreeze mechanic** that allows players to delay line clears and trigger powerful combo bursts.

The project focuses on **clean frontend architecture, modular game logic, and interactive UI design**.

# 🎮 Gameplay

IceStack is played on a **10×10 grid**. Instead of falling blocks like traditional Tetris-style games, players receive **three random blocks at a time** and can place them anywhere on the board.

### Core Rules

* The board is a **10×10 grid**
* Players receive **3 blocks simultaneously**
* Blocks can be **dragged and placed anywhere on the grid**
* A **row or column clears** when it becomes completely filled
* After using all 3 blocks, **three new blocks are generated**

### Game Over

The game ends when **none of the available blocks can be placed anywhere on the board**.

# ❄️ Freeze Mechanic (Unique Feature)

IceStack introduces a special **Freeze Mode**.

When **Freeze Mode is enabled**:

* Completed rows and columns **do not clear immediately**
* They become **frozen lines**
* Frozen lines remain on the board

When the player presses **Unfreeze**:

* All frozen rows and columns clear **simultaneously**
* A **combo bonus** is applied depending on how many lines clear together
* Visual effects (confetti) celebrate the combo

This mechanic adds a layer of **strategy and planning** not found in traditional puzzle games.

### Architecture Overview

**Game Engine Layer (`/game`)**

* Handles grid state
* Block placement validation
* Line detection
* Freeze / Unfreeze mechanics
* Scoring logic

**UI Layer (`/components`)**

* Game board rendering
* Block tray interface
* Controls and UI panels
* Theme switching
* Leaderboard display

This separation keeps the codebase **modular and maintainable**.
